SSEQ Player
===========

Introduction
------------

This is a homebrew player of Nintendo's SSEQ sequence format, used in commercial DS games.    
This uses the pitch table extracted from the (DS mode) GetPitchTable SWI function for non-buggy sound playback for DSiWarehax users!

How to use
------------

1. Place NDS_Music_Player.nds anywhere on the SD card.
2. Open SPS Maker, and select the folder with your .nds ROMs.
3. When the .sps file are done being made, take out your SD card and put it in your Nintendo DSi.
4. Launch the player with your DSi exploit.
